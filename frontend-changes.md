## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/index.html`
**Changes:**
- Added theme toggle button HTML structure with sun/moon SVG icons
- Button positioned as the first element inside `.container` div
- Includes proper ARIA label for accessibility

**Code Added:**
```html
<!-- Theme Toggle Button -->
<button id="themeToggle" class="theme-toggle" aria-label="Toggle theme">
    <svg class="sun-icon">...</svg>
    <svg class="moon-icon">...</svg>
</button>
```

**Location:** Lines 14-30 (after `<body>` tag, before `<header>`)

### 2. `frontend/style.css`
**Changes:**

#### A. Added Light Theme Variables
- Created `:root.light-theme` CSS variables for light mode color scheme

- Includes colors for background, surface, text, borders, shadows, etc.

**Code Added:** Lines 27-43

#### B. Theme Toggle Button Styles
- Fixed positioning (top-right corner)
- Circular button with responsive sizing (48px desktop, 44px mobile)
- Smooth transitions using cubic-bezier easing
- Hover effects with scale transformation and shadow
- Focus ring for accessibility
- Active state with scale-down effect

**Code Added:** Lines 786-858

#### C. Icon Animation System
- Sun and moon icons with smooth rotation and scale animations
- Icons transition between visible/hidden states based on theme
- Uses opacity and transform for smooth visual effects
- Dark theme shows moon icon, light theme shows sun icon

**Key Features:**
- Smooth 0.4s transitions with cubic-bezier easing
- Rotating animations (90deg rotation on icon change)
- Scale transformations (0 to 1) for smooth appearance/disappearance

### 3. `frontend/script.js`
**Changes:**

#### A. DOM Element Declaration
- Added `themeToggle` to global DOM elements list

**Location:** Line 8

#### B. Initialization
- Added `initializeTheme()` call in DOMContentLoaded event
- Loads saved theme preference from localStorage on page load

**Location:** Line 24

#### C. Event Listeners
- Added click event listener for theme toggle button
- Added keyboard navigation support (Enter and Space keys)
- Prevents default behavior for Space key to avoid page scrolling

**Code Added:** Lines 38-47

#### D. Theme Functions
Added two new functions:

**`initializeTheme()`** (Lines 235-246)
- Checks localStorage for saved theme preference
- Applies 'light-theme' class to document root if saved theme is 'light'
- Defaults to dark theme if no preference is saved

**`toggleTheme()`** (Lines 248-261)
- Toggles between light and dark themes
- Adds/removes 'light-theme' class from document root
- Saves theme preference to localStorage
- Ensures theme persists across page reloads

## Theme Color Schemes

### Dark Theme (Default)
- Background: `#0f172a` (dark blue)
- Surface: `#1e293b` (dark slate)
- Primary: `#2563eb` (blue)
- Text: `#f1f5f9` (light gray)

### Light Theme (Improved for Accessibility)
- Background: `#f8fafc` (light gray)
- Surface: `#ffffff` (white)
- Primary: `#1d4ed8` (darker blue for better contrast)
- Primary Hover: `#1e40af` (even darker on hover)
- Text Primary: `#1e293b` (dark slate - improved contrast)
- Text Secondary: `#475569` (medium gray - improved readability)
- Border: `#cbd5e1` (medium gray for visible borders)
- Code blocks: `#e2e8f0` background with `#cbd5e1` border

## User Experience

### How It Works
1. User clicks the theme toggle button (or uses Enter/Space key)
2. Theme instantly switches with smooth animations
3. Icon rotates and transforms (moon ↔ sun)
4. All colors transition smoothly via CSS variables
5. Preference saved to localStorage
6. Theme persists on page reload

### Responsive Behavior
- Desktop: 48px button size, 1.5rem spacing from edges
- Mobile: 44px button size, 1rem spacing from edges
- Button stays fixed in top-right across all screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Variables Approach
Using CSS custom properties allows instant theme switching without JavaScript manipulation of individual elements. The `:root.light-theme` selector overrides variables when the class is present.

### Icon Animation
Icons are absolutely positioned and animated using:
- `opacity`: 0 (hidden) to 1 (visible)
- `transform`: Combined rotate and scale
- `transition`: 0.4s cubic-bezier for smooth easing

### localStorage Integration
Theme preference is stored as:
- `'light'` - for light theme
- `'dark'` - for dark theme
- No value - defaults to dark theme

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with CSS custom properties support
- localStorage support
- SVG support
- CSS transforms and transitions

## Recent Improvements (Session 2)

### Light Theme Color Enhancements
**Changes made to improve accessibility and readability:**

1. **Improved Primary Colors**
   - Primary color: Changed from `#2563eb` to `#1d4ed8` (darker blue)
   - Primary hover: Changed from `#1d4ed8` to `#1e40af` (even darker)
   - Reason: Better contrast ratio for WCAG accessibility standards

2. **Enhanced Text Colors**
   - Text primary: Changed from `#0f172a` to `#1e293b` (improved readability)
   - Text secondary: Changed from `#64748b` to `#475569` (better contrast)
   - Reason: Darker text colors provide better contrast against light backgrounds

3. **Better Border Colors**
   - Border color: Changed from `#e2e8f0` to `#cbd5e1`
   - Reason: More visible borders that don't disappear on white surfaces

4. **Code Block Styling**
   - Added dedicated light theme styles for inline code and code blocks
   - Background: `#e2e8f0` (soft gray)
   - Border: `#cbd5e1` (subtle but visible)
   - Text: `#1e293b` (dark for high contrast)
   - Reason: Code needs to be highly readable with clear background differentiation

5. **Focus Ring Enhancement**
   - Focus ring: Changed from `rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.2)` to `rgba(29, 78, 216, 0.3)`
   - Reason: More visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation

6. **Welcome Message Background**
   - Changed from `#f0f7ff` to `#dbeafe` (slightly more saturated)
   - Reason: Better visual distinction from regular messages

### Accessibility Improvements
- All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Interactive elements have clear hover and focus states
- Code blocks have high contrast for readability
- Border colors are visible without being harsh

## Future Enhancements (Potential)
- System preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
- Additional theme options (e.g., high contrast, colorblind modes)
- Animation preferences (reduced motion support)
